This short and simple script can be used to find duplicate.
It doesn't tell you the number of duplicates, but it can be used to select all the duplicates and easily delete them all.

You should first create a new short integer field.
You need to also have the id field with which you can determine whether a record is unique or not. (in this example, I am suing OGF_ID.
Use calculate field on the newly created integer field and run the following script using code block option.
Duplicates will be assigned with number 1. all else will be zero.

id_list = []
def find_dup(id):
  global id_list
  if id in id_list:
    return 1
  else:
    id_list.append(id)
    return 0

find_dup(!OGF_ID!)
