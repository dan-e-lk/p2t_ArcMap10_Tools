The network version of the working 'python2_tools', for general network use, is the UNC for this SCOPE_NOTE:

	\\lrcpsoprfp00001\MNR_NER\GI_MGMT\Tools\Scripts\Python2_Tools_2020


How to set up local workstation:
0. Install git scm (google it)
1. Somewhere on your C drive, create a new folder.
2. Right click that folder and open Git Bash
3. type in git init
4. type in git clone https://github.com/dan-e-lk/python2_tools.git

If you are not one of the designated collaborator (i.e. if you are a user of this tool rather than editor),
you may want to update this folder from time to time to make sure you are using the most up-to-date tools/scripts.
You can do that by...

	git pull origin master

If you are a collaborator and when done editing,
	git push origin master



*** The key to the longevity of the use of the tools is versatility.***

The toolbox should be compatible with arcmap v10.1 - v10.8
